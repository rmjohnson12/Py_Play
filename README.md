# Py_Play

This repository will hold my python musings what this means is that the work in here isn't directly related to any of what I'm learning at Wake Tech.

I will be extensively using:

[automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) 

[invent with python](https://inventwithpython.com/)

[big book of small python projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)
